<p>The weekend of the Swiss Raku and Perl Miniconf coincides with the Ollon-Villars 
<a href="http://www.ollon-villars.com/">Historic Hill Climb</a>, which takes
place on the 26/27 August. If you're still in Villars on the 27th you can
watch some people driving up the mountain really fast in really old motors. 
Once you've caught the bus up to Villars you'll understand why this is 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98mW5PJyPkc">a bit</a> 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsHfusUA23M">bonkers</a>. 
This event only happens once every 4 years.</p>

<p>You can pick up the Free Access Card for 10 CHF (a day, 50 CHF for the season), 
which will give you access to the train and telecabine taking you up to Bretaye 
at 1,800m. There you have access to hiking and biking trails, or you could just 
visit one of the restaurants <a href="https://villars.roundshot.com/bretaye/">near the lake</a>.</p>

<p>In the village itself there are several restaurants, art galleries, shops, 
and spots to just stop and take in the views. Villars also has a recently 
rebuilt swimming pool with spa and sauna, ice skating rink, bowling alley, 
tennis courts, and plenty of routes to hike and bike - there are places where 
you can rent bicycles. Check out the 
<a href="http://www.villars-diablerets.ch/">official site</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If you are feeling adventurous you could try <a href="http://www.vues-aeriennes.ch/projects/">
paragliding</a>, say you're with the Swiss Raku and Perl Miniconf and you will get a 50CHF
discount on the Vol DÃ©couverte.</p>

<p><h3>Glacier 3000</h3></p>

<p>If you have transport then <a href="http://www.glacier3000.ch/en">Glacier 3000</a> 
is a short 30min drive over the Col de la Croix from Villars. There are two cable 
cars at Glacier 3000 to take you up to the highest point in the canton of Vaud, 
featuring a peak walk for those not afraid of heights. You can hike out (or be 
driven) to Refuge l'Espace at Quille de Diable. Highly recommended, on a clear 
day you will get a full panoramic view of The Alps, and have no problem seeing 
the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc.</p>

<p><h3>Going a bit farther</h3></p>

<p>You could visit the <a href="http://www.seldesalpes.ch/en/salt-mines/">Salt Mines</a> 
in Bex, or one of the many wine cellars in 
<a href="http://www.chateauaigle.ch/en/vineyard/cellar_visits_wine_tasting_sales">Aigle</a>. 
It's easy to spend a couple of hours at the 
<a href="http://www.chillon.ch/en">Chateau de Chillon</a> then head on to 
<a href="http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/montreux.html">Montreux</a> or 
<a href="http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/vevey.html">Vevey</a>, you can even take a 
boat trip out onto the lake. These locations are all within a short bus/train ride 
from Villars, and on the way to/from Geneva. If you stop by Lausanne there are 
plenty of museums and galleries, including the <a href="https://www.olympic.org/museum">Olympic Museum</a>.</p>
