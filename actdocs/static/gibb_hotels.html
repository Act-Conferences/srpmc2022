<!--
<p>Villars is a small ski resort that tends to be reasonably quiet during the summer months,
this means you shouldn't have a problem booking a room in one of the several hotels in the
village or renting an apartment or chalet for a few days. However, there is an event on
the weekend of the 26 and 27th of August, so you are advised to book in advance. If you
do find that demand is high then you can look at one of the neighbouring villages.</p>

<p>You will find that the majority of hotels and apartments/chalets in Villars are less than
a 10 minute walk from the conference venue, which is located right next to the station in the
village centre. Neighbouring villages are more like a 20 or 30 mins walk or a short bus or
train ride.</p>

<p><h3>Hotels</h3></p>

<p>There are several hotels in the village, as can be seen on <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNiBW5vcmVmaCyIAQGYAS64AQfIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQuSAgF5qAID&amp;lang=en-gb&amp;sid=275eb01aa1755f466547b30fae30105e&amp;track_lsso=1&amp;sb=1&amp;src=index&amp;src_elem=sb&amp;error_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Findex.en-gb.html%3Flabel%3Dgen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNiBW5vcmVmaCyIAQGYAS64AQfIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQuSAgF5qAID%3Bsid%3D275eb01aa1755f466547b30fae30105e%3Bsb_price_type%3Dtotal%26%3B&amp;ss=Villars-sur-Ollon%2C+Vaud%2C+Switzerland&amp;checkin_monthday=24&amp;checkin_month=8&amp;checkin_year=2017&amp;checkout_monthday=27&amp;checkout_month=8&amp;checkout_year=2017&amp;sb_travel_purpose=business&amp;room1=A&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=1&amp;group_children=0&amp;genius_rate=1&amp;ss_raw=villars-sur-ollon&amp;ac_position=0&amp;ac_langcode=en&amp;dest_id=-2554702&amp;dest_type=city&amp;search_pageview_id=2ec7888e7c7101f6&amp;search_selected=true&amp;search_pageview_id=2ec7888e7c7101f6&amp;ac_suggestion_list_length=5&amp;ac_suggestion_theme_list_length=0#map_opened-b_google_map_thumbnail">booking.com</a>.</p>
