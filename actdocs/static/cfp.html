[% WRAPPER ui title = "Call for papers" %]

<p>
Talks are the heart of the conference. They are usually 20 or 40 minutes long. There may also be lightning talks of 5 minutes, or extended talks of 60 minutes. We welcome proposals on any subject related to Raku or Perl, software development, devops, and so on. Because the venue has a few rooms we are also very open to any longer workshop-like ideas. This could be anything that 2-10 people can attend.
</p>

<p>
Please submit your talk proposal by <b>August 30th, 2022</b> under <a href="[% make_uri('newtalk') %]">New Talk</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please describe what is interesting about your proposed subject, how you are going to explain it, and how it will be of interest to attendees. Please note that we are only running one speaker track, with a second track for workshops, so your presentation should preferably address a broad range of experiences.
</p>

<p>
Even though Switzerland has four official languages we decided to use English as the conference language. This should allow everyone to follow and to participate, however if you are more comfortable speaking in another language that is perfectly fine too.
</p>

<p>
Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or comments.
</p>

<p>
We look forward to many interesting talks.
